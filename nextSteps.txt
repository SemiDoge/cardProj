TODO: Change the texture loading system from individual files to a texture map.
TODO: Add ability to click and drag cards (this should be done with via an offset).
TODO: Add logic that will allow for the ability to display certain textures over/under others. Probably with a small unsigned integer counter. E.g. start at 0 (lowest) and higher numbers display over lower numbers 
TODO: Create a proper card drawing system. Perhaps with an array of ints.
TODO: Decide if morphing cardProject into Solitaire is viable.
